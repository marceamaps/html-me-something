                When people think of Italy they think of Rome, Florence, and Venice. 
                What they often don't know is that there are amazing places to visit
                besides these major tourist destinations.
                Here are a list of my favorite places to visit in Italy.

                    <h2>A Word on Italy</h2>
                <p>While Italy is regarded as one of the most beautiful places on earth,
                    it's important to remember that the people who live there want to 
                    keep it this way! Remember when traveling to be respectful of Italians
                    and their customs, and that their lifestyle may be more different from yours
                    than you think. 
                </p>
                    <h3>Logistics</h3>
                <p>
                    Italy is on the &euro;, but cards are widely accepted. It's always a good
                    idea to notify your bank before you go. Travel is usually done through
                    public transit, so brush up on your italian before you go!
